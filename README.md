# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Robert Rousset's Week 3 Homework

This weeks project was creating a password generator in Javascript. This was my first time properly using Javascript and this activity really pushed me to figure out how to think in Javascript. I required a lot of help from the internet to figure out this problem and once I was shown the right path I understood the concepts in a lot more depth.

I started simple, with the prompts, and figured out how to have a confirm() prompt so that the answer is a boolean. Once I had each of the criteria as either true or false I could create the generatePassword function to only pass the characters If they're === true. 

I also needed to create a function to track how many characters the user wanted. This was difficult to figure out but eventually made a lot more sense once i completed it. I later added the else to repeat the function, making sure that the user can only select the desired values. 

Adding the correct characters to correspond with the correct variables/prompts was the part that was the most difficult to wrap my head around. I had to search around for answers to eventually find the fromCharCode() command which lists all characters as a value. This method is definitely quite clean and saved me a lot of time creating my own array's with all the possible characters. This definitely started making a lot more sense in my head once the bulk of it was out of the way and I have a much better understanding of the logic of Javascript and how to organize functions.
